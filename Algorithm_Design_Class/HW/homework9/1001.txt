Description
N cities named with numbers 1 ... N are connected with one-way roads. For each pair of cities i and j, you need to find the shortest path from city i to city j.

Input
The first line contains three integers N, K and Q (2<=N<=100, 1<=K<=10000, 1<=Q<=10000). N is the number of cities, K is the number of roads, and Q is the number of queries. Each of following K lines contains three integers i, j, d (1<=i,j<=N, 0<d<10000), indicates there is a road from city i to city j, and its length is d. The next Q lines describes the queries, each line contains two integers i and j (1<=i,j<=N). 

Output
For each query, you need to print the shortest path in one line. If there is no path between the query cities pair, you should print "-1".
