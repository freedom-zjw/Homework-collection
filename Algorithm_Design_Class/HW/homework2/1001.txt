Time Limit: 1sec    Memory Limit:256MB
Description
In the Fibonacci integer sequence, F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for n ≥ 2. For example, the first ten terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …
 
Given an integer n, your goal is to compute the last Fn mod (10^9 + 7).
Input
 The input test file will contain a single line containing n (n ≤ 2^31-1).

There are multiple test cases!

 

 

Output
 For each test case, print the Fn mod (10^9 + 7).
